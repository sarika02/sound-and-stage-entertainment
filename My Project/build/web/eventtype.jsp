             Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill.<br>
             Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things.<br>
             They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. <br>
           Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or <br>
           an organization;and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring.
